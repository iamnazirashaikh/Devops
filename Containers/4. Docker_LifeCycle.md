# Docker Lifecycle

The Docker lifecycle refers to the stages a Docker container goes through, from creation to removal. Understanding this lifecycle is essential for managing containers effectively. Here’s an overview of each stage in the Docker lifecycle:

**1. Image Creation**

Build: The Docker lifecycle begins with the creation of a Docker image. A Docker image is built using a Dockerfile, which contains instructions on how to set up the environment, install dependencies, and configure the application.

Pull: Alternatively, you can pull an existing image from a Docker registry like Docker Hub or a private registry.

**2. Container Creation**

Create: A container is created from an image using the docker create command. At this point, the container is defined, but it is not yet running. It has a unique ID and is in a created state.

Configure: During creation, you can configure various container options such as environment variables, ports, volumes, and networking settings.

**3. Container Start**

Start: The container is started using the docker start command, or you can create and start a container simultaneously with docker run. When a container starts, it executes the process defined in the image (often a single application or service).

Running: The container is now in the running state, actively executing the process inside it. This is the main operational state of a container.

**4. Container Pause/Unpause (Optional)**

Pause: A running container can be paused using the docker pause command. This suspends all processes in the container, preserving its state.

Unpause: You can unpause the container with docker unpause, resuming the execution of the processes.

**5. Container Stop**

Stop: The container is stopped using the docker stop command. This gracefully stops the main process inside the container by sending it a SIGTERM signal, followed by a SIGKILL if it doesn’t stop within a certain time frame. The container moves to the stopped state.

Kill: Alternatively, you can forcibly stop a container with the docker kill command, which immediately sends a SIGKILL signal to terminate the process.

**6. Container Restart (Optional)**

Restart: A stopped container can be restarted using the docker restart command. This is useful for updating or reloading the application without needing to create a new container.

**7. Container Removal**

Remove: Once a container is no longer needed, it can be removed using the docker rm command. This deletes the container’s metadata, logs, and any other associated resources, freeing up space on the host machine.

Automatic Removal: You can also create a container with the --rm flag, which automatically removes the container once it stops.

**8. Container Lifecycle Commands**

Inspect: The docker inspect command allows you to view detailed information about a container, including its current state, configuration, and resource usage.

Logs: Use docker logs to view the logs generated by a container’s processes, which is useful for debugging and monitoring.

Exec: The docker exec command allows you to run additional commands inside a running container, often used for debugging or management tasks.
Commit: You can create a new image from a running or stopped container using docker commit. This is useful for saving the current state of a container as an image.
