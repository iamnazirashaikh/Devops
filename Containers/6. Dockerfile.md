# It all starts with a Dockerfile

- A Dockerfile is a text file containing set of instructions for building your docker image
- The default filename should be `Dockerfile` without a file extension

# Dockerfile Instructions 

```bash
# Format for Docker Instructions

INSTRUCTION arguments
```
✍️The instruction is not case-sensitive. However, convention says to keep them in UPPERCASE to distinguish them from arguments more easily.

| `RUN <command>`| Executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the result. RUN also has a shell form for running commands.         |
| `WORKDIR <directory>` | Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.                    |
| `COPY <src> <dest>`   | Copies new files or directories from `<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path `<dest>`.                      |
