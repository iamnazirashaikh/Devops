# Docker

Docker Engine is natively supported on most modern Linux distributions also known as Docker CE. 

### Install Docker on Linux: [Check Here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Verify the installation by running:
  
    docker --version
    docker -v
    
### Install Docker on Windows(Docker Desktop):

Docker Engine is also available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, through Docker Desktop..

#### Prerequisites:
- Virtualization should be enabled in your system's BIOS.
- Windows 10: Pro, Enterprise, or Education
Version: 1909 and higher
Architecture: 64-bit

- Windows 11: All editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, Education)
Architecture: 64-bit

- Hyper-V enabled. The Home edition does not have Hyper-V, so Docker Desktop will use WSL 2 as the backend, making it compatible. Make sure you have the latest WSL
- To get latest WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
    - Run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator.
      - Press Win + X and select Windows Terminal (Admin), Command Prompt (Admin), or PowerShell (Admin).
Running the terminal as an administrator will give the necessary permissions to perform the update.
    - download and install the latest WSL version.
      ```bash
      wsl --update
  
#### Steps:
1. Download the installer from [Docker Official Website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) 

2. Double-click Docker Desktop Installer.exe to run the installer. By default, Docker Desktop is installed at C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker.

3. When prompted, ensure the Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V option on the Configuration page is selected or not depending on your choice of backend.
   If your system only supports one of the two options, you won't be able to select which backend to use.

4. Follow the instructions on the installation wizard to authorize the installer and proceed with the install.

5. When the installation is successful, select Close to complete the installation process.

6. All Docker command runs with admin priviledges. If your administrator account is different to your user account, you must add the user to the docker-users group:
   #### On Pro/Enterprise
    - Run Computer Management as an administrator.
    - Navigate to Local Users and Groups > Groups > docker-users.
    - Right-click to add the user to the group.
    - Sign out and sign back in for the changes to take effect.
  
   #### On Home Edition:
    - Option 1: Using Command Prompt
        - Open Command Prompt as Administrator: Press Win + X and select Windows Terminal (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin).
        - Add the User to docker-users Group. Use the following command, replacing username with your actual username:
            ```bash
            net localgroup docker-users username /add
        - Restart Docker Desktop


    - Option 2: Using PowerShell
        - Open PowerShell as Administrator: Press Win + X and select Windows Terminal (Admin) or PowerShell (Admin).
        - Add the User to docker-users Group
        - Run the following command, replacing username with your actual username:
          ```powershell
          Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "docker-users" -Member "username"
        - Restart Docker Desktop

    To verify if user is added to dockeruser-group, run the following command in powershell (Windows + X -> Terminal / Terminal(Admin)
   ```powershell
   Get-LocalGroupMember -Group "docker-users"

8. Start Docker Desktop: Docker Desktop does not start automatically after installation.
   #### To start Docker Desktop:
    - Search for Docker, and select Docker Desktop in the search results.
    - The Docker menu ( whale menu ) displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement.
    - Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:
        - Docker Desktop is free for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
        - Otherwise, it requires a paid subscription for professional use.
        - Paid subscriptions are also required for government entities.
        - The Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.
        - Select Accept to continue. Docker Desktop starts after you accept the terms.
        - Note that Docker Desktop won't run if you do not agree to the terms. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.
9. Verify the installation by opening a Docker Desktop -> Terminal ->
    ```bash
    docker --version
    docker run hello-world
    ```


### Install Docker on macOS:

#### Prerequisites:
- Ensure your macOS version is 10.14 (Mojave) or newer.

#### Steps:

1. Download Docker Desktop for Mac from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac).

2. Double-click the downloaded .dmg file to open the installer.

3. Drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder.

4. Launch Docker from the Applications folder.

5. Once Docker Desktop is running, you will see the Docker icon in your menu bar.

6. Verify the installation by opening a terminal and running:
    ```bash
    docker --version
    docker run hello-world
    ```

Make sure to check the official documentation for any updates or additional details that may have been released after my knowledge cutoff date.
